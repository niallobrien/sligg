// Customise Bootstrap styles
// 1) Bring your _variables.scss in first. The variables are defined with !default in the bootstrap _variables.scss file which means to use their value unless the value has already been defined.
// 2) Bring in bootstrap
// 3) Next mixins - prioritize your overwrites before other components that depend on them that you want to overwrite.
// 4) Next overwrites (like navbar, buttons, alerts, etc)
// 5) Finally, your own styles


// Bootstrap with Flexbox enabled. Uncomment to disable
$enable-flex: false;

@import "_variables";
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";
